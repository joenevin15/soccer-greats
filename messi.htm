       </p> Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when
        his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. 
        At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based
         club.

        
        <p>

        </p> There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history, helping his club win more than two
          dozen league titles and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and
           in 2019, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the sixth time.

            all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden
